# Central Square Parking
A map of parking usage in Central Square. Made for a course in transportation planning along with Tarun Gopalakrishnan and Daniel Youngwon Lee. The counts were done by hand from 4-8pm on three days in April."

This map draws substantially from Mike Bostock's <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet">Leaflet+D3</a> tutorial and <a href="duspviz.mit.edu/tutorials">Mike Foster's tutorials</a> on DUSPviz (very cool site), particularly for the legend.
