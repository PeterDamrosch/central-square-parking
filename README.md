# Central Square Parking
A map of parking usage in Central Square. Made for a course in transportation planning along with Tarun Gopalakrishnan and Daniel Youngwon Lee where we looked at parking usage and congestion in Central Square. The parking data was counted by the three of us from 4-8pm on three days in April.

This map draws substantially from Mike Bostock's <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet">Leaflet+D3</a> tutorial and Mike Foster's <a href="duspviz.mit.edu/tutorials">tutorials</a> on DUSPviz (very cool site), particularly for the legend.
